# MASTERMIND Game Paul Gleeson 5P PP2

# Introduction
Project portfolio 2 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: JavaScript Essentials.

Guess the color of hidden pegs. A deduction game where a player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the computer has hidden.

The Computer player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at a hidden place in the program. The player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the computer uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the computer hid at the beginning of the game.

## User Experience - UX

* As a web developer, I want to:
  
  1. Build an online quiz eye catching to the userâ€™s at first sight so they are interested in playing the game.
  2. Make it easy to navigate the game and for users to play.
  3. Make it enjoyable and challenging for the player. 
   
* When a new player joins they should be able to:

  1. Read and understand the instructions Easley.
  2. Navigate with simplicity.
  3. Get feedback from the game to enhance gameplay.
   
* Returning players:

  1. To be eager to beat there highest score.

## Design
<hr style="border:1px solid white">

### Wireframe
This is a mock-up of the intended build. Please note that some features may change during development as the project continues, but the image should be mostly accurate representation on the site.
<br>

<figure>
  <img src="assets/images/mockup.png" width=400>
</figure>

### Website Structure
The game is written on one page, that split into two sections and only one section will be visible at a time. Game section and instructions (How to Play) section. Both are available large screens and small devices.

On small screens the orientation is disabled as the game is not supported on small landscape devices. When a user rotates the screen they will be presented with a clear visual explaining that this is not available and the user is instructed to rotate there device.

 The main colour scheme that was chosen for this project to give a wooden feel (like the old game from the 80's) and is an mixture of brown tones and blue with a black background and white text for the instructions.

 #### Typography
* The two fonts were chosen for the site. Tilt Neon for title the main title and Lucida Sans for white text on a black background. 

font-family: "Tilt Neon", sans-serif;
font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;

      
#### Imagery
* No Imagery was used on this site
  
### Interactive Links  
* Four buttons and six color choice icons are interactive for the user. <br>
    

* How to play button: Brings the user to the help file and hide all other contents. <br>

### How to Play 
<hr style="border:1px solid white">

Guess the color of hidden pegs. A deduction game where a player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the computer has hidden.

The Computer player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at a hidden place in the program. The player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the computer uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the computer hid at the beginning of the game.

 
  * How to play Mastermind
       
  * First the user will click OK to close the "Computer is Ready to Play" alert.
  * The user then uses the right hand pannel consisting of 6 colours by clicking any one of the colours. 
  * This will begin to populate the first row of the game.
  * The user can continue making choices or they can use the "Change Answer" button.

    <img src="assets/images/btombutt.png" width=400>
    <figcaption>Change Answer</figcaption>
  </figure>

* The user must make four choices or: 
  * The computer will give an "Alert!" saying not enough colours chosen.

* Pages all load correctly on all device screen sizes.
* All social media links work correctly and open a new tab.
* All the buttons are working correctly and bring the users to the function that they were built for.
* The game is working correctly the question comes at the right time and it gives a reply back to the user when answered. 
* The score has no issues and it increases by 25 points any time the user gives a right anwser. 
* The progress bar and question counter have also no issues, the background color increases (from 0% to 100%) and the number of questions also increases any time the user chooses an anwser.

## Bugs 
### Text Overlaping Mobile Devices
![Text Overlaping Mobile Devices](./assets/images/readme/quiz-land-mobile-issue.jpeg)
* I had this issue with my project when I built the layout for the Quiz Page as they are many elements in the same page.<br>

### Fixed Bug
![Fix Bug](./assets/images/readme/quiz-land-bug-mobile-fixed.png)
* I had to add media queries for portrait and landscape to avoid this issue happening.<br>
