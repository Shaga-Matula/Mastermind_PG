# MASTERMIND Game Paul Gleeson 5P PP2

## Discptrion 

Guess the color of hidden pegs. A deduction game where a player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the computer has hidden.

The Computer player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at a hidden place in the program. The player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the computer uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the computer hid at the beginning of the game.
