# MASTERMIND Game Paul Gleeson 5P PP2

# Introduction
Project portfolio 2 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: JavaScript Essentials.

Guess the color of hidden pegs. A deduction game where a player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the computer has hidden.

The Computer player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at a hidden place in the program. The player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the computer uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the computer hid at the beginning of the game.

## User Experience - UX

* As a web developer, I want to:
  
  1. Build an online quiz eye catching to the userâ€™s at first sight so they are interested in playing the game.
  2. Make it easy to navigate the game and for users to play.
  3. Make it enjoyable and challenging for the player. 
   
* When a new player joins they should be able to:

  1. Read and understand the instructions Easley.
  2. Navigate with simplicity.
  3. Get feedback from the game to enhance gameplay.
   
* Returning players:

  1. To be eager to beat there highest score.

## Design
<hr style="border:1px solid white">

### Wireframe
This is a mock-up of the intended build. Please note that some features may change during development as the project continues, but the image should be mostly accurate representation on the site.
<br>

<figure>
  <img src="assets/images/mockup.png" width=400>
</figure>

### Website Structure
The game is written on one page, that split into two sections and only one section will be visible at a time. Game section and instructions (How to Play) section. Both are available large screens and small devices.

On small screens the orientation is disabled as the game is not supported on small landscape devices. When a user rotates the screen they will be presented with a clear visual explaining that this is not available and the user is instructed to rotate there device.
